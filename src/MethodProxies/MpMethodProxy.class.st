"
I implement a method proxy that can wrap a method and do something before/after it.
I'm implemented as a stratified proxy: the specific instrumentation and the implementation of the instrumentation are separate concerns.
I am responsible of the instrumentation implementation, and I delegate to a handler object the corresponding instrumentation.
This allows users to define their own concerns without caring about specifics of the implementation.

## Basic Usage

A proxy is created by giving the method to wrap and a handler.
The proxy is not installed by default in the system.
Send it the message `install` to make it available.

```smalltalk
	mp := MpMethodProxy onMethod: Context >> #aboutToReturn:through: handler: (handler := MpCountingHandler new).
	mp install.
```

After installation the proxy will trap calls to the wrapped method and transfer them to the handler.
To uninstall a proxy, send it the message `#uninstall`

```smalltalk
	mp uninstall.
```

Check the implementation of `MpHandler` to understand how to define new handlers.

## Implementation notes

To instrument method executions, I use normal methods and literal patching which plays very well with the JIT and inline caches.
The general strategy is the following.

The original method is installed in the method dictionary with another selector (an object instance of `MpHiddenSelector`).
A trap method accepting the same number of arguments than the original method is copied, then it is patched so it forwards the message to the previously crafted selector.
Since the instrumented method is installed with a selector that has only one sender, this will become a monomorphic linked callsite after the first call.

Moreover, trap methods have been optimized to avoid allocating ensure blocks, stack reifications and other subtleties required for stack unwind (correct management of exceptions and non-local returns) which makes it very slow. Trap methods are thus written as:

```smalltalk
MpMethodProxy class >> trapWith: arg1 with: arg2
  | handler |
  handler := ""some object that understands value"".
  ...
```

This allows

- unwind without extra blocks and less contexts
- having a very fast execution path without unwind in the middle.

On top of this, the handler of traps is set as a literal that is patched.

That literal is a normal object (`MpProxyInstrumentationDeactivator`) that on value inspects the stack (we are in the slow case anyways, who cares! :D) and performs what is required to do.
